# 🤖 Chatbot for FAQs

### 📘 Project Overview
The **FAQ Chatbot** is an intelligent Natural Language Processing (NLP)–based application that automatically answers frequently asked questions (FAQs) about a product, service, or organization.  
It helps users get **instant and accurate answers** without the need for human support.  

This chatbot uses **NLTK** for text preprocessing and **TF-IDF with Cosine Similarity** to match user questions with the most relevant answers.  
It includes a clean **Streamlit-based chat interface** for easy interaction.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Collect FAQs**  
   Prepare a list of frequently asked questions and their answers.  
2. **Preprocess Text**  
   Each question is cleaned using NLP techniques (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).  
3. **Convert to Vectors (TF-IDF)**  
   Convert all questions into numerical representations.  
4. **Match User Query**  
   When a user types a question, cosine similarity finds the closest FAQ.  
5. **Display Answer**
